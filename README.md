# üîß APT Upgrade Tool

A simple and reliable Bash script to safely upgrade all APT packages one at a time, ideal for use on Debian-based systems such as **Ubuntu** or **Kali Linux**.

This tool is especially helpful when you encounter **broken or partially installed packages**, offering a cleaner and more controlled upgrade process.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Refreshes package lists (`apt update`)
- Detects all upgradable packages
- Upgrades each package individually for better visibility and error isolation
- Automatically removes unnecessary packages (`apt autoremove`)
- Safe and transparent process with clear terminal output

---

## üì¶ Installation

### 1. Download or create the script file `upgrade.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [[ "$1" == "--help" ]]; then
    echo "Usage: upgrade"
    echo "Safely upgrades APT packages one by one and performs cleanup."
    exit 0
fi

sudo apt update
UPGRADABLE=$(apt list --upgradable | grep -oP '^\S+' | tail -n +2)

for package in $UPGRADABLE; do
    echo "Upgrading $package..."
    sudo apt install --only-upgrade -y "$package"
done

sudo apt autoremove -y

echo "All packages upgraded."
```

### 2. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x upgrade.sh
```

### 3. Move it to `/usr/local/bin` for global access:

```bash
sudo mv upgrade.sh /usr/local/bin/upgrade
```

### 4. Run it from anywhere:

```bash
upgrade
```

## üí° Use Case

This tool is particularly useful on systems like **Kali Linux**, where:

- Packages often break due to aggressive or custom installations
- You want better visibility and control over the upgrade process
- You want to recover from a broken or inconsistent APT state

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Requirements

- Debian-based Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, Kali, Debian)
- `apt` package manager
- `sudo` privileges

---

## ‚è∞ Optional Automation

To automate upgrades, add the tool to your crontab:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Example entry to run weekly at 2 AM:

```bash
0 2 * * 1 /usr/local/bin/upgrade >> /var/log/apt-upgrade.log 2>&1
```
